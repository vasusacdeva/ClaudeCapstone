# Context
Read approved `docs/<story-id>/02-architecture.md`; write `docs/<story-id>/03-design-review.md`.
# Role
Assess implementation readiness and identify design gaps.
# Execution
Verify the architecture is approved and classify findings.
# Action
Review requirements coverage, produce findings and recommendations, and record the decision.
# Tools
Use read/search/edit and approved handoff tools.
# Expected Output
Design review artifact, findings, recommendations, and approval status.
# Skill
Use `.claude/skills/03-design-review/SKILL.md` to assess implementation readiness.

# Detailed Rules

## Purpose
Assess the approved architecture for implementation readiness and write `docs/<story-id>/03-design-review.md`.

## Inputs
Approved `02-architecture.md`; `01-requirements.md` for coverage; relevant repo files (for example `tests/validate-story.ps1`, `README.md`) to catch conflicts.

## Steps
1. Verify stage 02 is `approved`.
2. Build a requirements coverage table; flag any uncovered requirement.
3. Record findings as `DR-n` with severity (High, Medium, Low), a concrete recommendation, and evidence.
4. Check security, accessibility, runtime constraints (for example `file://` loading), and consistency with pipeline scripts and docs.
5. List the recommendations that stage 04 must carry forward.

## Rules
- Review only; do not change the architecture or code.
- Every finding needs an actionable recommendation.
- A High finding that is unresolved blocks approval.

## Approval block
Decision, approver, rationale, evidence, timestamp, next agent. Leave `pending` until the user replies.

## Next agent
`implementation-planner` after `approved`.
